        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome to my page!
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Panayiota Sketsiou and I have recently completed my Ph.D. in geophysics and seismology.
            I find it a fascinating subject, and something that a lot of people and children would be interested to know more about,
            so I created this page which provides basic information on earthquakes, as well as how earthquakes can be useful and provide information about the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working as a consultant, but outside of work
            I enjoy baking for my friends and family, cooking, and learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you find the content useful, and enjoy your browsing!
