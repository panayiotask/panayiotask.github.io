            <h3>Introduction to Seismology</h3>
            <p><em>Seismology</em> is the study of earthquakes and and the generation and propagation of elastic waves through the Earth or other planetary bodies.
                <p>A <em>seismologist</em> is a scientist who studies earthquakes and seismic waves.</p>

            <p>The Earth is divided in layers.
                Broadly speaking, there are three main layers: the crust, the mantle, and the core.
                These layers have all different chemical and mechanical properties</p>
            <p>
                The thinnest layer is the crust - this is the outermost layer.
                There are two types of crust - continental and oceanic - which vary in thickness, density and composition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The crust and upper (rigid) part of the mantle form the lithosphere.
                The lithosphere is broken into fragments, called <em>tectonic plates</em>, which move very slowly over the upper mantle.
                It is around 100km on average and is solid and brittle - this means that it breaks under pressure. This is where earthquakes (EQs) occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below the lithosphere, but still in the mantle, you will find the asthenosphere - the denser, weaker layer which lies between about 100-400km below the surface of the Earth.
                The lithosphere and asthenosphere have the same chemical composition, but have different mechanical properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below this is the lower mantle - which is hotter and denser, and much less ductile than the upper mantle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core is at the centre - it is under a huge amount of pressure and is extremely hot - the inner core is solid, whereas the outer core is liquid.

            <h3>Earthquakes</h3>

            <p>An earthquake is the sudden release of strain energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in waves of shaking that radiate outwards from the earthquake source.
                When stresses in the crust exceed the strength of the rock, it breaks along lines of weakness, either a pre-existing or new fault plane.</p>
            <p>The point where an earthquake starts is termed the <em>focus</em> or hypocentre and may be many kilometres deep within the earth.
                The point at the surface directly above the focus is called the <em>earthquake epicentre</em>.
            </p>
            <p>Intense vibrations, or <em>seismic waves</em>, spread out from the initial point of rupture (the focus) like ripples on a pond.
                These waves are what makes the ground shake and can travel large distances in all directions.
                Near the focus, the waves can be very large, making them extremely destructive.
            </p>

            <h3>Seismic waves</h3>
            <p>Seismic waves are divided in two categories, according to their type:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Body waves</li>
                <li>Waves waves</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These categories are further broken down. More details on seismic waves can be found in <a href="EQwaves.html"> EQ waves</a>.
