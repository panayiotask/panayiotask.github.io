        <h2>Seismic waves and earthquakes</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Seismic waves</h3>
            <p>
                A seismic wave is a mechanical wave of acoustic energy that travels through the Earth or another planetary body. It can result from an earthquake (or generally, a quake), volcanic eruption, magma movement, a large landslide, and a large man-made explosion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seismic waves are recorded using seismometers, hydrophones (in water), or accelerometers.
                These waves carry energy and transmit information about the Earth's internal structure and the source of their generation.
            </p>

        <section class="EQwaves-types">
            <h3>Types of seismic waves</h3>
            <p>There are two categories of seismic waves:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Body waves:</b> these are waves that travel through the Earth's interior, propagating within its layers. There are two types of body waves:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Primary waves (P-waves)</li>
                            <li>Secondary waves (S-waves)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Surface waves:</b> these are waves that travels along the Earth's surface. These waves primarily move along the boundary between the Earth and its atmosphere:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rayleigh waves (R-waves)</li>
                            <li>Love waves (L-waves)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                These are discussed in more detail below.
            </p>

        <section class="P-waves">
            <h4>Primary waves</h4>
            <section class="Pwaves-image">

            </section>
            <p>P-waves, or Primary waves, are a type of seismic wave generated by various natural phenomena like earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.
                These waves are the fastest seismic waves and are the first to arrive at a seismic station after an earthquake occurs.</p>
                <p>The key characteristics of P-waves are:</p>
                
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wave type:</strong> P-waves are compression waves, meaning they cause particles in the material through which they travel to move back and forth in the same direction as the wave's propagation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> They travel through solid materials, liquids, and gases, making them the fastest seismic waves. In solids, their speed is typically around 1.5 times faster than the speed of S-waves (Secondary waves).</li>
                        <li><strong>Propagation:</strong> P-waves can propagate through the Earth's layers by compressing and expanding the material. This ability allows them to pass through solids, liquids, and gases, but their speed and direction may change when transitioning between different materials.</li>
                        <li><strong>Particle motion:</strong> The particles in the material through which P-waves travel experience alternating compressions and rarefactions in the direction of the wave's movement. This motion is similar to the movement of a slinky being pushed and pulled longitudinally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Impact on structures:</strong> While P-waves travel quickly, they usually cause less severe damage to buildings and structures compared to other seismic waves, such as S-waves and surface waves. However, they still contribute to the ground shaking experienced during an earthquake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <p>
                The detection and analysis of P-waves, alongside other types of seismic waves, can be used to determine various parameters of an earthquake, such as its location, depth, magnitude, and the nature of the Earth's layers it has passed through.

        <section class="S-waves">
            <h4>Secondary waves</h4>
            <section class="Swaves-image">
                <img src="../assets/Swaves-image.png">
            </section>
            <p>S-waves, or Secondary waves, are a type of seismic wave generated by geological events like earthquakes or other disturbances within the Earth.</p>
                <p>The key characteristics of S-waves are:</p>
                
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wave type:</strong> S-waves are shear or transverse waves, causing particles in the material through which they travel to move perpendicular to the direction of the wave's propagation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> These waves travel only through solid materials and are slower than P-waves. In solid materials, their speed is typically about 60% to 70% of the speed of P-waves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Propagation:</strong> S-waves cannot travel through liquids or gases, as they require a solid medium to propagate. They cause the material they travel through to deform by moving particles perpendicular to the wave's direction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Particle motion:</strong> As S-waves move through a material, they cause particles to move side-to-side, creating a shearing motion within the material, similar to the movement created when shaking a rope from side to side.</li>
                        <li><strong>Impact on structures:</strong> S-waves are responsible for causing a significant amount of ground shaking during an earthquake. They contribute to the shaking of buildings and structures, and their inability to pass through liquids often leads to their disappearance or attenuation in regions with liquid layers in the Earth's interior.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <p>
                The detection and analysis of S-waves, alongside other types of seismic waves, can be used to determine various parameters of an earthquake, such as its location, depth, magnitude, and the nature of the Earth's layers it has passed through, and assess potential seismic hazards in various regions.

            <h4>Rayleigh waves</h4>
            <section class="Rwaves-image">
                <img src="../assets/Rwaves-image.png">
            </section>
            <p>Rayleigh waves are a type of surface seismic wave that propagates along the surface of the Earth. They are named after the British scientist Lord Rayleigh, who mathematically predicted their existence.</p>
                <p>The key characteristics of Rayleigh waves are:</p>
                
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wave type:</strong> Rayleigh waves are surface waves, combining characteristics of both longitudinal and transverse waves. They travel along the boundary between the Earth and its atmosphere.</li>
                        <li><strong>Propagation:</strong> These waves cause the ground to move in an elliptical, rolling motion, similar to the motion observed in ocean waves. They move in a backward-rotating, elliptical motion, with the largest amplitude at the Earth's surface and diminishing amplitude with depth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Particle motion:</strong> Rayleigh waves cause particles in the material to move in a retrograde elliptical path, with vertical and horizontal components, causing the ground to roll and vibrate in the direction of wave propagation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Rayleigh waves are slower than body waves (P-waves and S-waves) but are generally faster than Love waves, another type of surface wave.</li>
                        <li><strong>Effects:</strong> Rayleigh waves are responsible for much of the shaking and damage observed during an earthquake. Their larger amplitudes and rolling motion can cause significant ground displacement and damage to structures.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <p>
                Rayleigh waves, along with Love waves, contribute significantly to the destructive effects of seismic events, especially at the Earth's surface. Studying the characteristics and behavior of Rayleigh waves helps seismologists understand the impact of earthquakes and surface-related geological phenomena.

            <p>Love waves are a type of surface seismic wave that propagates along the Earth's surface. They are named after the British mathematician A. E. H. Love, who mathematically predicted their existence.</p>
                <p>The key characteristics of Love waves are:</p>
                
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wave type:</strong> Love waves are surface waves, similar to Rayleigh waves, and they propagate along the boundary between the Earth and its atmosphere.</li>
                        <li><strong>Propagation:</strong> These waves cause the ground to move in a side-to-side (horizontal) motion perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. They travel with a motion resembling that of a snake slithering across the ground.</li>
                        <li><strong>Particle motion:</strong> Love waves have a horizontal shearing motion that occurs in a horizontal plane parallel to the Earth's surface. The particles move in a side-to-side motion, causing the ground to oscillate horizontally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Love waves are typically slower than Rayleigh waves but faster than most other surface waves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Effects:</strong> Love waves contribute to the ground shaking during an earthquake and can cause significant horizontal movement of the Earth's surface. They are responsible for producing much of the horizontal ground motion observed during seismic events.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <p>
                Love waves, along with Rayleigh waves, are among the surface waves that significantly impact the destructive effects of earthquakes.

            <h3>Earthquakes</h3>

            <p>Measuring earthquakes involves assessing various parameters that define the size, location, and impact of seismic events. Seismologists utilize specialized instruments called seismometers or seismographs to record and analyze the seismic waves generated by earthquakes. These waves carry crucial information about the Earth's structure and the energy released during the event. The magnitude and intensity of earthquakes are the primary metrics used for measurement, aiding in understanding the earthquake's impact and potential consequences.</p>
            <p>The image below shows an example of the North Anatolia Fault Zone (black solid lines), where seismic stations (blue triangles) were located to record erthquakes, and the location of seismic events (red and green diamonds).</p>

            </section>
            <p>Magnitude serves as a fundamental measure of an earthquake's size, representing the total energy released at the earthquake's source. The most commonly used magnitude scale is the Richter scale, which quantifies earthquake size based on the amplitude of seismic waves recorded by seismographs. Each whole number increase on the Richter scale corresponds to a tenfold increase in the amplitude of seismic waves and approximately 31.6 times more energy released. However, modern practices also utilize the moment magnitude scale (Mw) for larger earthquakes, as it provides a more accurate representation of an earthquake's true size and energy release.</p>
            <p>Intensity, on the other hand, assesses the earthquake's effects on people, buildings, and the environment at specific locations. The Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale quantifies the earthquake's impact on a scale from I to XII, with lower values indicating minimal effects and higher values signifying severe damage. This scale relies on observations and reports from people in affected areas to determine the level of shaking, structural damage, and its impact on communities, helping to understand the human and societal consequences of an earthquake.</p>
            <p>Seismic networks worldwide continuously monitor and analyze seismic activity, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of earthquake patterns and their potential hazards. By integrating magnitude and intensity measurements, seismologists and emergency responders can assess the severity of an earthquake, predict aftershocks, and implement appropriate mitigation strategies to reduce the impact on lives and infrastructure.</p>
