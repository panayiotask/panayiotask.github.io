        <h2>How can earthquakes be useful to humanity?</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Earthquakes, though often associated with destruction and disaster, also play an essential role in shaping our understanding of the Earth's dynamics and geological processes.</p>
            <p>These seismic events serve as nature's powerful tools, providing invaluable insights into the Earth's structure, tectonic movements, and the behavior of rocks and faults. </p>
            <p>Understanding the significance of earthquakes goes beyond their immediate impact, shedding light on plate tectonics, seismic hazards, and even aiding in the exploration of natural resources.</p>

            <h3>Seismic tomography</h3>
            <p>
                Seismic tomography is a technique used in geophysics to create detailed three-dimensional images of the Earth's interior based on seismic waves. Similar to medical tomography (like CT scans), which produces detailed images of the human body's internal structures, seismic tomography aims to visualize the Earth's composition, density, and geological features below its surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method relies on analyzing seismic waves generated by earthquakes or artificially induced vibrations. Seismographs worldwide record the arrival times and characteristics of these waves as they travel through the Earth's layers. By measuring the variations in wave speed, direction, and amplitude, scientists can infer the properties of the materials through which the waves have passed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seismic tomography involves complex computational algorithms to process large amounts of seismic data and create detailed models of the Earth's subsurface structures. It helps scientists map changes in the Earth's composition, identify subsurface anomalies such as magma chambers or tectonic plate boundaries, and gain insights into the behavior of seismic waves as they interact with different geological materials. This technique plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the Earth's interior and contributes significantly to studies in geology, seismology, and plate tectonics.
