        <h2>Live monitoring of earthquakes</h2>
        <p>Earthquake monitoring involves the continuous observation, detection, and analysis of seismic activity worldwide.
          A network of seismographs, strategically positioned across the globe, records seismic waves generated by earthquakes or other sources of ground movement.</p>
        <p>These sensitive instruments capture the subtlest ground vibrations, transmitting real-time data to centralized monitoring centers.
          By analyzing the recorded seismic waves' amplitude, frequency, and arrival times, seismologists can determine an earthquake's location, depth, magnitude, and the characteristics of the Earth's layers it traversed.</p>
        <p>This monitoring system plays a pivotal role in early warning systems, enabling timely alerts and providing vital information for emergency response planning and earthquake risk mitigation strategies.</p>

        <h3>Earthquake monitoring resources</h3>
        <p>Several earthquakes offer live monitoring of earthquakes. Some of them are:
          <ol>
            <li><a href="https://ds.iris.edu/seismon/index.phtml"> IRIS</a> (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) is a collaborative consortium of more than 120 universities and research institutions dedicated to advancing seismological research, education, and global seismic data sharing. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards"> USGS Earthquake Hazards Program</a>: The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides a comprehensive platform offering real-time earthquake monitoring, earthquake maps, seismic data, and information about recent earthquakes globally. Their website offers interactive maps, data feeds, and resources for both the public and researchers.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.emsc-csem.org"> EMSC (European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre)</a>: EMSC offers live earthquake information and seismic activity across Europe, the Mediterranean region, and globally. Their website provides real-time earthquake alerts, maps, and data from various seismic stations.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.geonet.org.nz/"> GeoNet (New Zealand)</a>: GeoNet monitors and reports seismic activity in New Zealand. Their website offers live earthquake information, including recent earthquakes, seismic data, and monitoring reports for the region.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/#lang=en&pattern=earthquake_volcano"> Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)</a>: The JMA monitors seismic activity in Japan, providing real-time earthquake information, maps, and data related to earthquakes and volcanic activity in the country.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          These websites offer various tools, maps, and data visualizations, allowing users to track recent earthquakes, access historical seismic data, and stay updated on seismic events happening globally or in specific regions.
